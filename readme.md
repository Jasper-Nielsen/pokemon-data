### My Pokemon grid App
This program was made as a mandatory assignment during my first semester studying datamatiker at KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.

This program takes dataobjects from a JSON file containing 27 pokemon objects, and displays them in a grid sorting them according to their name. The type of the pokemon dictates each grid items layout.

You can click on each pokemon object to get more info on these.

to try it yourself

Thanks goes to my fellow students each contributing to the data and general good working admosphere. 

Also a thanks to our teachers for making programming fun.
